## Contribution

You are very welcome and encouraged to make contributions to this repository! Currently, it has data that I (Martin) have collated to run my forecast [Buckley's & None](buckleysandnone.com). This is relatively minimal, national two-party preferred results for polls and high level election results. I hope that this changes as people contribute more detailed and historical data.
